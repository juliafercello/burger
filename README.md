# Project Overview
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

When a user adds a burger to the list - it is inserted into the MySQL database and the display is updated to show the new burger.

Users can mark a burger as "eaten" by clicking the "eat me" button.  When a burger is eaten, the eaten flag is updated and the page is reloaded with the burger now displayed in the "already eaten" section of the page.
